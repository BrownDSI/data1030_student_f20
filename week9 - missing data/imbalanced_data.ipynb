    "    - fraud detection\n",
    "    - sick or not sick (usually by far most people are not sick)\n",
    "- we learnt to not use a metric that relies on the True Negatives in the confusion matrix\n",

    "## What else can I do if I have an imbalanced dataset?\n",
    "- most (but not all) classification algorithms we covered have a parameter called `class_weight` which allows you to assign more weight to the class 1 point\n",
    "    - a misclassified class 1 point will contribute more to the cost function than a misclassified class 0 point\n",
    "    - read the manual on `class_weight` because the different algorithms have slightly different definitions for this parameter\n",
    "    - usually you can use `None`, `balanced`, or manually define what the class weight should be\n",
    "    - it is worthwhile to tune this parameter if you have an imbalanced dataset\n",
    "- resample/augment the dataset\n",
    "    - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813)\n",
    "    - to improve the balance of the problem, new class 1 examples are synthesized from the existing examples\n",
    "    - be careful though!\n",
    "        - while resampling improves the balance of the dataset, the results of the model can be misleading\n",
